Of course. That is a critical step for the initial user experience. I will add a dedicated, high-visibility section for this instruction in the `galaxyVewer` setup guide.

# Project electPyNasa & galaxyVewer

**A Submission for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 - Algiers, Boumerdes**

This project is a comprehensive suite of tools designed to process and visualize high-resolution astronomical imagery. It consists of two main components: `electPyNasa`, a desktop application for image processing, and `galaxyVewer`, a web-based, interactive deep zoom viewer.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a seamless workflow for astronomers, researchers, and space enthusiasts to take raw astronomical data (like FITS files from the James Webb Space Telescope), process it into a beautiful, viewable image, and explore it in stunning detail through an interactive web interface.

## 1. `electPyNasa` (Desktop Image Processor)

`electPyNasa` is a powerful desktop application built with Electron and Python. It serves as the backend processing engine, equipping users with the necessary tools to prepare their astronomical images for visualization.

### Key Features:
*   **Grayscale Image Stretching:** Applies a Generalized Hyperbolic Stretch (GHS) to single-channel FITS or TIFF files, enhancing detail in both shadows and highlights.
*   **Color Compositing:** Combines three separate grayscale images (representing red, green, and blue channels) into a full-color composite. It uses `astroalign` to ensure the channels are perfectly aligned.
*   **Deep Zoom Pyramid Tiling:** Converts massive TIFF or JPEG images into a Deep Zoom Image (DZI) pyramid using the high-performance `libvips` library. This format is essential for the smooth, high-speed streaming and zooming experience in the `galaxyVewer`.

### Setup and Installation

#### A. Prerequisites
Before installing the project dependencies, you must have Python 3, pip, and the `libvips` command-line tool installed on your system.

1.  **Python 3 & Pip:** Ensure `python3` and `pip` are available in your system's PATH.
2.  **libvips:** This is a critical dependency for pyramid tiling.
    *   **On Debian/Ubuntu:**
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install libvips-tools
        ```
    *   **On macOS (using Homebrew):**
        ```bash
        brew install vips
        ```
    *   **On Windows:**
        *   Download the latest `vips-dev-w64-all-x.y.z.zip` from the [libvips releases page](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/releases).
        *   Extract the folder to a stable location (e.g., `C:\vips-dev-8.15`).
        *   Add the `bin` subdirectory (e.g., `C:\vips-dev-8.15\bin`) to your system's PATH environment variable.

#### B. Install Dependencies

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd electPyNasa
    ```
2.  **Install Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install numpy opencv-python astroalign tifffile astropy
    ```
3.  **Install Node.js packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, run the following command from the `electPyNasa` directory:
```bash
npm start
```

## 2. `galaxyVewer` (Web-Based Deep Zoom Viewer)

`galaxyVewer` is the frontend visualization platform. It takes the DZI pyramids generated by `electPyNasa` and presents them in an immersive, interactive interface that can be accessed from any modern web browser.

### Key Features:
*   **High-Resolution Deep Zoom:** Utilizes OpenSeadragon to provide a smooth, lag-free experience when panning and zooming into gigapixel-sized images.
*   **AI Chatbot Navigator:** A conversational assistant powered by the Groq LLaMA 3.1 model allows users to navigate to specific points of interest using natural language commands (e.g., "Show me the Mystic Mountain").
*   **Interactive Markers:** Pre-defined points of interest are marked on the image, providing users with titles and descriptions of key astronomical features.
*   **WebRTC Live Streaming:** A unique feature allowing a "streamer" to start a session and share their view of the deep zoom image in real-time. "Viewers" can join a room using a simple code and follow the streamer's exploration, making it an ideal tool for guided tours and educational purposes.

### Setup and Installation

#### A. Prerequisites
You only need Node.js and npm installed on your system.

#### B. **IMPORTANT: Unzip the Default Image Tiles**
The default Carina Nebula image tiles are included in a zip file. You must extract them before running the server.

1.  **Find the file:** Inside the `galaxyVewer` directory, locate the `deepzoom-images.zip` file.
2.  **Unzip it:** Extract the contents of the zip file directly into the `galaxyVewer` root folder.

This will create a `deepzoom-images` directory at the same level as your `public`, `app.js`, and `server.js` files. **If you skip this step, the default image will fail to load.**

#### C. Install Dependencies
1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd galaxyVewer
    ```
2.  **Install Node.js packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the web server:**
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
2.  **Access the application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8081`.

## The Complete Workflow

Follow these steps to go from raw data to interactive exploration:

1.  **Process Images with `electPyNasa`:**
    *   Use the **Single Mode** tab to apply GHS stretching to your individual FITS or TIFF files.
    *   Use the **Batch Mode** tab to combine your stretched R, G, and B channel images into a final color composite TIFF.

2.  **Create the DZI Pyramid:**
    *   In `electPyNasa`, go to the **Pyramid Tiler** tab.
    *   Select the final color composite TIFF as the input file.
    *   **Crucially, set the output directory** to the `galaxyVewer/deepzoom-images/` folder within the web app's project structure.
    *   Click "Create Pyramid". This will generate a new folder (e.g., `my-nebula_files`) and a `.dzi` file inside the `deepzoom-images` directory.

3.  **Start the `galaxyVewer` Server:**
    *   Navigate to the `galaxyVewer` directory and run `node server.js`.

4.  **Explore and Stream:**
    *   Open `http://localhost:8081` in your browser.
    *   Your newly processed image should now be available in the "Select Image" dropdown menu.
    *   Select it to begin exploring, interact with the chatbot, or click "Create Room & Start Stream" to share your session with others.
